To run, use the command line arguments:
-text /path/to/training/file 
-test /path/to/eval/file 
-perp 

When -perp is present, it prints the perplexity of the entire corpus; when not, it prints the logProb for each sentence in the -test file.

Other programs can use the STLM by making a SuffixTree<T> object and putting that as the only argument into a STLanguageModel<T> constructor. The T can be anything, though you MUST implement
a equals() method otherwise objects that appear the same might be treated as different (i.e., in HashMaps, etc.). 

For an example, open up STLM.java and see how a SuffixTree is trained, either line by line or individually.
